# Simple Genetic Algorithm
A Python script that implements a genetic algorithm to help travelers optimize their luggage contents. The script takes user inputs for various items' names, weights, and values. Using the genetic algorithm, it then suggests the best combination of items to maximize value while adhering to a luggage weight threshold.

## Project Description
### Introduction: 
The "Luggage Checker" program is a tool that helps you optimize packing your suitcase by selecting the best combination of items based on their weights and values. This program employs genetic algorithms to find the most efficient packing solution, resembling the classic Knapsack Problem.

    Getting Started: Upon running the program, you will be prompted to provide information about ten items you want to pack. For each item, you'll need to enter its name, weight (in kg), and value (ranging from 1 to 100).

    Optimization Process: Once you've entered the details of all ten items, the program will begin the optimization process using genetic algorithms. This involves multiple generations of evaluating and selecting combinations of items for your suitcase.

    Optimal Packing: After completing the optimization process, the program will display the optimized selection of items that you should carry in your suitcase. These items have been carefully chosen to maximize the total value while adhering to the weight constraint of your suitcase.

    Displaying Results: The program will present a table that lists the item number, item name, weight, and value of each selected item. This output will help you visualize the optimized packing solution.

    Additional Information: Throughout the program's execution, you will encounter various formatting styles, such as bold, italics, and colors, that enhance the user experience and make the output more readable.

    End of Execution: Once the program has completed its optimization process and displayed the optimal packing solution, you can proceed with packing your suitcase based on the provided information. This solution will ensure you get the most value out of your luggage while staying within the weight limits.

    Note: Keep in mind that this program is a creative rendition of the Knapsack Problem, and the items you should pack are determined using a genetic algorithm. The provided output is a suggestion, and you can modify or adapt the packing solution based on your preferences and needs.

By following these rules, you can effectively use the "Luggage Checker" program to optimize your packing and make the most of your suitcase's space and weight capacity.
